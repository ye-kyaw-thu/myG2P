The main purpose of this tutorial is introduction to Myanmar language Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) conversion and   
explaining how to build a word-level G2P tagging model with one of the CRF toolkits named CRFSuite in details.  
I used myG2P dictionary version 1 (the 1st G2P dictionary for Myanmar language) for this tutorial.
I also uploaded some perl scripts for your practical exercises.
